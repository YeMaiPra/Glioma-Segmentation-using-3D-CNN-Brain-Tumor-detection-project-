# Glioma-Segmentation-using-3D-CNN-Brain-Tumor-detection-project-

3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for
the detection of brain tumors in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. A brain
tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within the brain or central spinal canal, which
can disrupt normal brain function and cause a range of symptoms. Early detection
and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors is essential for effective treatment planning.
The proposed method integrates multi-scale contextual information from different
levels of abstraction using dilated convolutions (CNN) and a multi-fiber network.
The multi-fiber network is designed to extract features from MRI scans at different
scales, capturing the different levels of abstraction in the data. To evaluate our
approach, experiments will be conducted on the BraTS 2018 dataset, a large MRI
dataset for brain tumor segmentation containing multimodal image data for every
patient.
